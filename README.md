# Module 4 Challenge PyCity Schools Analysis using Pandas 

In this assignment, we need to create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data. We need to help the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, we've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. We have been given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Our task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

## Challenge Details

* Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, create a report that includes analysis 
  report based on the calculation, a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.

* First calcualte the District Summary. Perform necessary calculations and then 
  create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame. Include the following:

  - Total number of unique schools

  - Total students

  - Total budget

  - Average math score
 
  - Average reading score

  - % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

  - % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

  - % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

* Next step is to calculate School Summary. Perform necessary calculations to 
  create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school. Include the following:
  - School name

  - School type

  - Total students

  - Total school budget
 
  - Per student budget

  - Average math score

  - Average reading score

  - % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

  - % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

  - % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

* Find the Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

* Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

* Create a dataframe that lists the average math score for students of each 
  grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

* Create a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each 
  grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

* Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending 
  ranges (per student).

* Create a DataFrame that breaks down school performance based on school size 
  (small, medium, or large).

* Create another DataFrame that shows school performance/scores based on the 
  "School Type".
  
## Assumptions made while coding

  **1.** The data CSV files that are reviewed in this analysis is present under 
         the Resources folder of the PyCitySchools folder.

  **2.** The python kernel path matches to the path where the challenge files 
         are located

  ## How to execute code?

  **1.** From the jupyter notebook, go to the cell column on the task bar and click on Run All option.
  
  **2.** Results for all the cells will be displayed under them for review.
 

### Prerequisites  
 * Need to have python3 installed.
 * The path to run the file on terminal should align with the folder path where 
   the csv file is saved on machine.
 * Need to run the code in sequential order to activate the results from 
   previous cells

### Steps to run

  * From the PyCitySchools folder under pandas-challenge, open 
    "PyCitySchools_Analysis.ipynb" file in Jupyter notebook.

  * First cell is the analysis of the data, where a brief summary can be found 
    of the calculations done on the sample school and student data. 

  * Start running each cell starting with first importing the pandas library 
    and other libraries needed to execute the code without any errors or From the jupyter notebook, go to the cell column on the task bar and click on Run All option.
  * On the last cell, you can find the conclusions and comparisons from the 
    analysis.

## Results 
 * Results of each cells are displayed under them individually.

 * There are few cells on the jupyter notebook that just have some mathematical 
   operations done. This is done to prepare the data to be used to in the next upcoming cells.

 * The written report on the first cell presents a cohesive written analysis 
   that: 

    - Summarizes the analysis done.

    - Draws two correct conclusions or comparisons from the calculations.

  * The written report is also attached as a word document in the analysis  
    folder under the PyCitySchools folder.
